 title: First Steps In Our Journey From 0 To 100 Customers
---

Here ye, here ye! Gather around, all entrepreneurs, wantrepreneurs and bootstrappers! This is the story of how a lowly bootstrapper built a successful business on a shoestring budget.

OK, I'm kidding... there is no epic story yet. Just a very humble beginning. But I want to share our journey with every one wanting to build their own business. Regardless if you're an wantrepreneur or an entrepreneur, you know that we all make mistakes and we should learn from them. Even better, let's learn from other people mistakes or successes. I know I've learned a great deal from [Alex Turnbull of Groove](https://www.groovehq.com/blog) or [Josh Pigford of Baremetrics](https://baremetrics.com/blog) and I've decided to share my journey as it happens (btw, Im keeping an eye on [Kilometer.io blog's](http://www.kilometer.io/blog) too). 

Like in many startups, we are a team of 3: Me, Myself and I . Me is in charge of development, Myself handles marketing and I takes care of the business problems. And like many entrepreneurs, we are bootstrappers (read: have little to no money). But that's ok, humans are quite creative when they don't have enough resources. This is when innovation happens and great products appear (do you know how Nutella came to be? During World War 2, a chocolatier trying to make this cocoa supplies last longer used hazelnut butter). 

My project is called MarketKPI and it's about helping managers or owners of an online marketplace to get strategic, big picture business insights and track Key Performance Indicators (KPI). MarketKPI takes care of identifying KPIs, designing events and displaying the information (usually as charts or tables), while a client needs only to send the required data. And while there are generic data mining and analytics solutions, they're all do-it-yourself type, when one has to invest a lot of time (and money) to get some value. 

So, at this point I think I have a pretty good USP, especially since a lot of specialized solutions are about marketing or targeting SaaS or ECommerce stores and none seems to care about marketplaces. I've already identified what marketplace types will be supported and my One Note contains all the needed metrics, formulas and events. Learning from the best, this time I didn't start by coding the whole app (I've committed this sin a few times in the past). I've only created a [landing page](http://www.marketkpi.com), this blog and a [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/marketkpi). 

Until now the total cost is 9.84$ and that's the cost of the domain name (my registrar is Namecheap and you can always find a coupon by googling). I don't pay anything for the landing page and blog hosting, they are hosted for free on Github Pages. I do have an old shared hosting account (5$) which I'm using for the mail servers. For now, I'll be using Google analytics and maybe Calq.io (they have a free plan) if I want a bit more marketing insight. For logging, I'll be using LogEntries (free plan as well). Of course, being a technical guy I'll do all the development, so no cost there.

I'm writing this to show you that you can start an online business on a very slim budget, you don't need funding if you have the technical know-how or you're willing to learn. If you're an wantrepreneur, stop contemplating and start doing it. Really, think about an idea that can be useful, come up in your head or on a piece of paper with how it will work, **think about how you'll _monetize_ it** and just create a landing page, telling the world about your idea. It should take you less than a week and less than 20$.

So, this is my first step in building my business. I have no clients and well, only my wife knows the project exists. It's time to get the word out and chew some bubblegum and I'm out of words..
