 title: Why Some Startups Fail and Why Others Are Successful
---

There is a very nice [site](tp://autopsy.io/) where you can read about failed startups and the main reasons they failed, straight from the founders themselves.

But let's be optimists and read about how others made it. Start [here](http://kirjonen.me/how-dropbox-got-75000-wait-list-signups-from-digg/) and read the success stories of Dropbox, Quora, Fouraware, Reddit,
Groupon, Tinder or Airbnb. Oh, you want even more? There's a youtube channel ["How to Start a Startup"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxIJaCMEptJjxmmQgGFsnCg) with great presentations from Paul Graham or Adora Cheung (Homejoy) .

It's amazing how much information is out there and the opportunities we have to learn about how to avoid some mistakes, as well as being inspired by the people who managed to build a successful startup, despite the odds.
